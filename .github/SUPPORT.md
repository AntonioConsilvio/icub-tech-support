#### General rules for posting

- All **issues are public**, but to post a new issue you need a github account (free).
- Post here any request for **robot maintenance** (issues related to hardware and/or robot configuration files); for general questions so as code specific issues, please refer to corresponding repositories \(e.g. [**`community`**](https://github.com/robotology/community), [**`yarp`**](https://github.com/robotology/yarp), [**`icub-main`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main) ...\).
- When asking to repair a broken part, please try to **provide as many details as possible** about the conditions in which the failure happened. This will help us narrow down the problem and, possibly, will also serve to take actions in order to mitigate the number and the impact of further occurences.
