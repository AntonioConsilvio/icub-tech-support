#### General rules for posting

- All **issues are public**, but to post a new issue you need a github account (free).
- Post here any request for **robot maintenance**; for general questions so as code specific issues, please refer to corresponding repositories \(e.g. [**`QA`**](https://github.com/robotology/QA), [**`yarp`**](https://github.com/robotology/yarp), [**`icub-main`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main) ...\).
- Please tag the question with the **label corresponding to the robot name** to ease the search; try to avoid replicating the name in the question title then.
- To be able to assign **labels** to questions, ask maintainers to become a **collaborator**.
